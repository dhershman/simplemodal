#Simple Modal Design jQuery and js 
---

* This small side project is a really easy way to create lightbox style modals for your site and such. Requires jQuery 
  * Simple copy and paste method good to go
  * Completely editable to your needs and customizable css

This is a far from optimized setup, its better than a cloggy yui but not a replacement for jQuery-ui etc. thanks for checking out my little projects
